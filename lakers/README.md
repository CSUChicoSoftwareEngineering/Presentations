##Purpose:
Gradebook is a simple, easy to use, and helpful computer application for instructors in any 
educational institution that need to keep track of students, their grades, and assessments. If your 
institution uses Blackboard Learn or Moodle to manage your courses, but you find it too complicated to 
use either of the applications, then don’t worry because Gradebook can import students from either 
Blackboard Learn or Moodle. Gradebook gives access to graphs that display how the students 
preformed on a particular assessment so you can make a better, faster, and more accurate judgments 
when you need to adjust grades. You also have the freedom to use the Gradebook application on a 
Macintosh or Windows computer. Not only can you choose what type of computer to run Gradebook 
on, but you have the flexibility to decide where to store one single file that contains your entire 
Gradebook information. One advantage would be for Instructors to store the information file in a cloud 
service such as Dropbox where the instructor can share the file with their teacher assistances.
